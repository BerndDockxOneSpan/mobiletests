# Mobile end-to-end tests

Currently, the available tests consist of the desktop webauthn tests, ported to mobile.

## Running

To run the tests, make sure appium is installed and running, and the `UiAutomator2` driver is installed. 
Additionally, these tests require chromedriver to be installed, Appium can download this automatically if it is run with
the `--allow-insecure chromedriver_autodownload` argument.
