- Setup/Dependencies: Device with locked PIN, reset workflow

### Test Case Idea 4
- Function/Feature: Lockout Mechanisms
- Scenario: Enter wrong PIN 3 times (temporary lockout) and 8 times (permanent lockout)
- Importance: Ensures device enforces security policies
- Expected Result: Device requires USB re-insertion after 3 attempts, locks after 8 attempts
- Setup/Dependencies: Device, PIN entry automation

### Test Case Idea 5
- Function/Feature: Credential Limit
- Scenario: Register 100 credentials, attempt 101st registration
- Importance: Verifies device storage limits and error handling
- Expected Result: 101st registration fails, error shown, no data corruption
- Setup/Dependencies: Device, registration automation

### Test Case Idea 6
- Function/Feature: Environmental Conditions
- Scenario: Operate device under extreme temperature/humidity/vibration
- Importance: Validates device reliability and compliance
- Expected Result: Device functions within specified limits, errors outside limits
- Setup/Dependencies: Environmental test equipment

### Test Case Idea 7
- Function/Feature: Long-Term Storage Reliability
- Scenario: Store credentials and PIN, power cycle device over weeks/months
- Importance: Ensures non-volatile memory reliability
- Expected Result: Credentials and PIN persist, no corruption
- Setup/Dependencies: Device, long-term test plan

### Test Case Idea 8
- Function/Feature: Platform Compatibility
- Scenario: Test all operations on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, multiple browsers
- Importance: Ensures cross-platform support
- Expected Result: All features work as documented on each platform
- Setup/Dependencies: Multiple devices/OS/browsers

### Test Case Idea 9

## 5. Additional Proposed Test Case Ideas

### Test Case Idea 11
- Function/Feature: PIN Management
- Scenario: Attempt to change the PIN by providing an incorrect "old" PIN.
- Importance: Verifies that the PIN change operation is secure and requires correct old PIN validation.
- Expected Result: The PIN change operation fails with a specific error message indicating the old PIN is incorrect. The original PIN remains unchanged.
- Setup/Dependencies: A device with a PIN already set.

### Test Case Idea 12
- Function/Feature: PIN Management
- Scenario: Attempt to set a new PIN that does not meet the length requirements (e.g., 3 characters or 65 characters).
- Importance: Ensures strict enforcement of PIN policies for security.
- Expected Result: The operation is rejected with an error message explaining the PIN length requirements (4-63 bytes).
- Setup/Dependencies: A device in a state where a PIN can be set or changed.

### Test Case Idea 13
- Function/Feature: Credential Management
- Scenario: Register a credential on one operating system (e.g., Windows) and then attempt to use it for authentication on a different operating system (e.g., macOS or Linux).
- Importance: Validates the cross-platform compatibility and portability of discoverable credentials.
- Expected Result: The credential can be successfully used for authentication on the other platform without re-registration.
- Setup/Dependencies: Access to multiple test machines with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Test Case Idea 14
- Function/Feature: Security and Lockout
- Scenario: After triggering the 3-attempt temporary PIN lockout, disconnect and reconnect the device.
- Importance: Verifies the temporary lockout behavior and ensures the device correctly resets the attempt counter after being re-powered, as described in the manual.
- Expected Result: After reconnection, the PIN prompt is available again, and the temporary lockout is cleared.
- Setup/Dependencies: A device and a script to automate incorrect PIN entries.

### Test Case Idea 15
- Function/Feature: Device Reset
- Scenario: Initiate a factory reset while the device is in the middle of a FIDO2 operation (e.g., waiting for user presence).
- Importance: Tests the robustness of the reset functionality and ensures it can handle being triggered from any state.
- Expected Result: The ongoing FIDO2 operation is terminated, and the factory reset process completes successfully, wiping all data.
- Setup/Dependencies: A script to initiate a FIDO2 operation and a way to trigger a reset concurrently.

### Test Case Idea 16
- Function/Feature: Error Handling
- Scenario: Disconnect the device from the USB port during a critical operation, such as while a new credential is being written to the device.
- Importance: Tests the device's resilience to power loss and its ability to recover without data corruption.
- Expected Result: The device does not get bricked or enter a corrupted state. Upon reconnection, it is in a stable state, and the failed operation can be safely retried.
- Setup/Dependencies: A method to precisely time the USB disconnection during a FIDO2 operation.
